## Introduction

**Purpose of the Repository:** This repository is a both a professional demonstration of my development capabilities, as well as a personal self-documentation/self-review journey of my learning experience over (atleast) a month, as I refresh and refine my skillset after a significant period off from actively programming.

**Profesionally**, this repository serves as an simplified entry point to a portfolio consisting of a series of projects that present both a snapshot of my current active skillset, as well as demonstrating my potential capacity for learning and growth over a short period of time. This repository as well as the projects should also demonstrate my ability to incrementally leverage the technology, understanding and resources that I have access to, in order to achieve both added value and further potential for growth.

**Personally**, this repository serves as a way to review and document what I have learnt during this time as well as to review and refine my learning processes.

I hope this portfolio also demonstrates my passion for learning, growth and building stuff!

*I also really like transparency!*

*I will add to this overview repository incrementally over a few days, or a week or two. (or three).*


**The majority of Projects** in this repository share a **common functionality** at their first and final major release, while utilizing different techonlogies for implementation.

At **1.0.0+** the major projects have:
- A **Service Layer** that is responsible for fetching data from a an external service.
- A **Presentation/Interface Layer** that initally displays a simple header, and below it a request data button. Once the request data button is pressed the application enters a **state transition**, requests data through the service layer and displays a circular loading indicator until the request is resolved. Generally there are only two outcomes as a result of this transition:
    1. **Success:** Displays a list of data in a structured format, fetched from the [The Dog API](https://www.thedogapi.com).
    2. **Error Handling:** In case of request failure, an error snackbar is displayed to inform the user.

- **Unit Tests** for each layer separately
- **Integration/E2E Tests** with both layers
- Push-Build-Test-Deploy **CI/CD process**

## Roadmap

For this repository, the following developments are planned/considered:

- [ ] **Development Journey:** Document the learning and decision making process in sequence.
- [ ] **Learning Milestones:** Identify major areas of new knowledge and understanding.
- [ ] **Challenges/Solutions:** Include sections on setup requirements, usage instructions for running, and testing.
- [ ] **Skills Acquired:** Define aquired skills that were explicitly demonstrated in the projects.
- [X] **Personal Logs/Journals Archived:** I may include *(mostly)* unsanaitized copies of my personal learning journal, as well as the ad-hoc versioning changelog I used for each project before I wanted to subject it to public version control systems (i.e. before minimum viable product).
- [ ] **Further Reflections:** Reflect on my decisions, my strategy, how I can build on the experience and assets gained from these projects, and draw conclusions. Among other things.  

## Data Source

- **The Dog API:** The applications in this portfolio use data from [The Dog API](https://www.thedogapi.com). I route the traffic through my own private backend proxy in order to secure my user key for the API, in line with the [The Dog API TOS](https://thedogapi.com/terms).
