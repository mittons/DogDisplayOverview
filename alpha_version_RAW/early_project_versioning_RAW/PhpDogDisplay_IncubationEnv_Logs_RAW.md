### Reflections:
First iteration of my dog breed list display parctice project in PHP.

This project just has the nessecary setup to route json data from one endpoint to another.

It has a seperate service layer and a interface/presentation layer.
- Service layer fetches data from external REST api
- Presentation/interface layer exposes the data on another endpoint.

### Notable (Milestone) Resources Created:
- Had to set up some cert stuff for php to work with external endpoints. Not included in the project it self but my solution was:
    - Inlucded ca cert file(cacert.pem) from url: "https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html"
    - Placed in folder: "F:\Programs\php_certs"
    - Added a reference to the cert file in the folder in php.ini at line with text: "curl.cainfo ="


## PROJECT DIR: dogs-in-php-part-02
### About Project:
Meant to build upon [dogs-in-php-part-01] and add html template rendering using the data from the external endpoint it fetching data from. E.g. not just a json router anymore, but a json transformer now.

## PROJECT DIR: dogs-in-php-part-03
### About Project:
Meant to build upon [dogs-in-php-part-02] and implement unit testing for both the server-side interface layer and the service layer. ***Still needs finishing though***

Also changed the service to be more injectable and moved the base api url into some config file.

- Also aligned the initial template to the c++ and python projects
