# early_project_versioning_RAW

This folder contains the files I use to to log and keep track of the changes in each local iteration of the software linked to in this portfolio overview.

This folder contains changelogs for some of the projects included in this portfolio overview. 

I developed some of the projects locally before placing them on github, and kept an ad-hop track of the project changes (and my own progress and learning). I versioned them simply by adding an index to the project folder name, creating a copy of the project directory each time whatever i had been working on was functional.

I decided to not place these projects into a public repository until I had somewhat robust code, with tests that cover the main features and at least some comments. And a README entry point, as well as a LICENSE file and my best current attempt at referencing THIRD_PARTY_LICENCES.

**These files are not really meant to be read indepth.** As they are not really sanitized or edited. They are just here for transparency, and my own self reflection requirements when I've iterated this learning process documentation repository to a more refined state. This is a version control system after all. These files are part of the alpha version.
