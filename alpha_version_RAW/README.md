# alpha_version_RAW

**These files in this directory and its subdirectories are not really meant to be read indepth.** As they are not really sanitized or edited. They are just here for transparency, and my own self reflection requirements when I've iterated this learning process documentation repository to a more refined state. This is a version control system after all. This folder contains the alpha version of this repository.
