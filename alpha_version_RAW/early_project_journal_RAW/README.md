# early_project_journal_RAW

This folder contains the ad-hoc journal I kept for these projects while hyperfocusing on getting the MVP I could put into git.

**This file is not really meant to be read indepth.** As it is not really sanitized or edited. It is just here for transparency, and my own self reflection requirements when I've iterated this learning process documentation repository to a more refined state. This is a version control system after all. These file is part of the alpha version.
