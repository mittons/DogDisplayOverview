## [0.2.0] - 2024-01-16

## [0.2.1] - 2024-01-16

### Changed
- **Moved the part of the intro text that covers the standard functionality:** of the main projects to the projects overview section. It reduces the volume of the introduction text, making entry to the first impression/intro to the project less taxing. As such improving the experience.

- **Moved the tech stack section of the projects overview:** to its own section. Some parts of the intro section got moved to the projects overview section, and in order to avoid overloading that section the tech stack part was better off on its own.

- **Changed the Data Sources section to Acknowledgements sections:** refined the text for Dog API and added AI contribution text.

## [0.2.2] - 2024-01-16

### Added
- **Preface:** Added a short preface to describe the document, highlight its main features and point to the ones I precieve as having most value.

## [0.2.5] - 2025-01-30

## [0.3.1] - 2024-02-11

### Added

## [0.3.3] - 2024-02-11

### Added
- **First actual commit the DogDisplayStaticClient repository:**
    - I think it's appropriate to make note of the fact that the [DogDisplayStaticClient repostiory was created](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayStaticClient/commit/65614749c0874504d11377f1c62aad45be00c16d) a minute after this [DogDisplayOverview repository was created](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayOverview/commit/befd51c5fb0dd766ba1bbd269d647c8d12814dcc). It's information that fits the purpose of this repository.
