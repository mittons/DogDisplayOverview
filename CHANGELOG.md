## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-13

### Added

- **Repository Initialization**: Established the DogDisplayOverview repository, along with the main entry point (README.md), with an initial focus on project documentation and reflection.

- **Main Project Descriptions**: Listed and provided brief overviews of the main projects in the portfolio, focusing on their purposes and the technologies used.

- **Technology Stack Overview**: Described the technology stack and tools used across various projects within the repository.

- **Project Goals and Objectives**: Defined both professional and personal goals for the repository, including skill demonstration and iterative learning documentation.

- **Roadmap Development**: Drafted a preliminary roadmap outlining future plans and visions for the repository's growth and development.


## [0.1.1] - 2024-01-16

### Added

- **Version control:** Added (this) CHANGELOG.md for keeping track of the iterative changes made to this project as it develops further.


## [0.1.2] - 2024-01-16

### Added

- **RAW alpha data:** Added the raw data this repository will partially be developed out of, for transparency and reflection.


## [0.2.0] - 2024-01-16

### Added

- **Roadmap development:** Closed off an item, in v0.1.2, from the roadmap presented in the README.md. Updating minor version.



## [0.2.1] - 2024-01-16

### Changed
- **Moved the part of the intro text that covers the standard functionality:** of the main projects to the projects overview section. It reduces the volume of the introduction text, making entry to the first impression/intro to the project less taxing. As such improving the experience.

- **Moved the tech stack section of the projects overview:** to its own section. Some parts of the intro section got moved to the projects overview section, and in order to avoid overloading that section the tech stack part was better off on its own.

- **Changed the Data Sources section to Acknowledgements sections:** refined the text for Dog API and added AI contribution text.

## [0.2.2] - 2024-01-16

### Changed
- **Fixed link error in Acknowledgements secion of README.md:** Link to ChatGTP tos was misformatted.


## [0.2.3] - 2024-01-17

### Changed
- **Fixed file type error in RAW data meta-documentation:** README.txt in journal folder has now been changed to README.md. Markdown file type is the correct file type

## [0.2.4] - 2024-01-30

### Added
- **Preface:** Added a short preface to describe the document, highlight its main features and point to the ones I precieve as having most value.

## [0.2.5] - 2025-01-30

### Fixed
- **Line spacing in the read me list of project:** It was a bit off after the last update.

## [0.3.0] - 2024-02-11

### Added
- **Setting the stage:** Laid down the finish line in the roadmap section.

## [0.3.1] - 2024-02-11

### Added
- **The initial step after breaking out of CHAOS, into ORDER.** CHAOS diversifies, ORDER assembles. When both have done their work a FIT can be found. 0.3.0 reflected the switch from CHAOS to ORDER as a feature. It's time to assemble. 
    - PATCH increments can now reflect assembly.
    - Version v0.4.0 will reflect the moment when the client/server projects have been assembled and the process logged.
    - Version v0.4.0 will enable assembly of this repository.

## [0.3.2] - 2024-02-11

### Added
- **Realized the attribution required to publish the final project that is needed as input for the finale of this documentation journey / reflection repository**

## [0.3.3] - 2024-02-11

### Added
- **First actual commit the DogDisplayStaticClient repository:**
    - I think it's appropriate to make note of the fact that the [DogDisplayStaticClient repostiory was created](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayStaticClient/commit/65614749c0874504d11377f1c62aad45be00c16d) a minute after this [DogDisplayOverview repository was created](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayOverview/commit/befd51c5fb0dd766ba1bbd269d647c8d12814dcc). It's information that fits the purpose of this repository.

## [0.3.4] - 2024-02-12

### Added
- **Started building and designing the end product contents of this repository**

## [0.3.5] - 2024-02-12

### Added
- **Clarified intended design and purpose of projects, transparently setting expectations, enforcing accountability towards stated intent.**

## [0.3.6] - 2024-02-13

- **Updated the earliest projects that this repo is derived from to be more up to my current standards when it comes to licensing, attribtution, and acknowledgement.**

## [0.3.7] - 2024-02-13

- **Project has clear scope now!**

## [0.3.8] - 2024-02-13

- **Initial PoC for this project**
    - Showcase of bash learning curve. [BashLearningCurve.md](PoC_markdown_documents\BashLearningCurve.md)

## [0.3.9] - 2024-02-14

- **Acknowledged some of the older project had already gotten a bit of work done on their attribution facing side**

## [0.3.10] - 2024-02-15

**Added the final software code project to the Overview Project list of projects.**
- The client facing project, DogDisplayStaticClient.

## [0.4.0] - 2024-03-07

### Changed

**Resumed work**
- Started by cleaning the environment. Still a few steps left there before I move forward, starting work in a clean environment is always good. But Order is now being established. And the current projects will be finalized, before further Chaos can ensue.

**Course correcting the statements, on further versioning, made in this changelog for version 0.3.1:**
  - v0.4.0 is now, as the research phase is done for the code projects, the scope has been defined in the broadest terms. The reasearch Chaos has ended and Ordered assembly has begun.
  - v0.5.0 will be when the code projects have been assembled, and v0.5.0 will enable exploration of how this repo can be assembled (along with some assembly).
  - v0.6.0 will be when this repo has receieved a clear scope and the only steps left are ones of assembly and figuring out minor nuances.
  - Later versions, what happens after the initial assembly of this repository, will remained undefined for now.

  ## [0.4.1] - 2024-03-14

  ### Changed

  1. **Gained awareness, course corrected:**
    - This project and the projects it derives from on lower priority now (but not by much), until:
        - I finish a project that recently came up (it will come to a conclusion on March 16th)
        - Work a bit on another that has been ongoing for a while.
        - Work a bit on a third one that has also been going on for well, a year.
    - It won't be for long though, but I might chill until in April and finish this then. Or not, it's undecided.
    - I gained awarness that was relevant to a project that was forming in my mind, both thought provoking and validating. I ended up realizing how it could fit in to my larger goals, but that I would have to fit it into my timeframe for other stuff (Ill leave that undefined, but with what's going on in my life it could be one or more of 3 different things. That are all coming to a convergence somehow. But at least two of them are urgent, one of them very). I am not beyond course correcting when I gain new awareness, even though I do practice integrity. But I do try to tell people when I course correct to regulate expectaions, but perhaps I could do better.

## [0.4.2] - 2024-04-05

### Added

  1. **Started convergence of the DogDisplay projects. (And possibly a few others)**

  2. **Automation of setting up most or all application dependencies for full testing of all combinations of the static client, cpp/php/python servers, and the mock/prod data sets**
     - Started pseudocoding the outline. Fed it as [a prompt into chatgpt](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayStaticClient/blob/b7276855db016c221c13eedfab079a7b0be6e087/dev_scripts/refresh_dev_test_apps_dir_script_gpt_prompt.md). [Got this script as output, as is](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayStaticClient/blob/b7276855db016c221c13eedfab079a7b0be6e087/dev_scripts/refresh_dev_test_apps_dir.sh).


## [0.4.3] - 2024-04-05

### Added

  1. **Automation of setting up most or all application dependencies for full testing of all combinations of the static client, cpp/php/python servers, and the mock/prod data sets.**
    - Completed.
