# **🚀 Next Steps**
🔹 **Decide the project’s deployment strategy.**   
🔹 **Document the process for others (open-source contribution?).**  *( user annotation: yes this journey was documented in real time, as it unfolded, unfiltered, and (besides one or two exceptions) completely unedited.* *)*  
🔹 **Apply lessons learned to new projects.**
